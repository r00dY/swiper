# SimpleSwiper

SimpleSwiper allows you to simply implement swipers with mobile app grade gesture handling. It doesn't limit itself to images. You can place in slides any HTML content you want.

# To do

1. Clean up Storybook.
2. Make calling "layout" unnecessary in ReactSimpleSwiper. Make comparison in componentDidUpdate smart so that it knows when it should call .layout again.
